# NEIGHBORHOOD-MAP

### Visit Madrid!!!

This is the implementation for the project "Neighborhood Map" within Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.
In this project I have marked the most popular museums in Madrid (my home town) in order to make them more know if possible

### How to ...

You can download the project by the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/davidmunoz4185/NEIGHBORHOOD-MAP.git

```

and open "index.html" in your favorite browser ...


### Which info ...

I´ve used google and wiki apis to show the information I think is relevant. Once you click in a marker, you can see the photo which is a link to museum wiki´s page
with all the information you need

I hope you like!!!
